/**
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
/* 
Given a string that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can replace any letter in the string with another letter at most k times. Find the length of a longest substring containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

Note:
Both the string's length and k will not exceed 104.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "ABAB", k = 2

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
Example 2:

Input:
s = "AABABBA", k = 1

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

public class Solution {
    
        public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int len = s.length();
        int[] count = new int[26];
        int start = 0, maxCount = 0, maxLength = 0;
        for (int end = 0; end < len; end++) {
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, ++count[s.charAt(end) - 'A']);
            while (end - start + 1 - maxCount > k) {
                count[s.charAt(start) - 'A']--;
                start++;
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
//end - start + 1 : the length of window 
//maxCount will record the max time that a character appears.
// (end - start +1) - maxCount = times that we need to switch so that we can get all characters in the window to be the same characters.
